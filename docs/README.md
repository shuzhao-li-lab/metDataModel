# Designing the data structures

Generic data structures are key for different computational steps or software tools to work with each other, 
and for testing and reproducibility.

The empirical compound definition is central to our works in metabolomics.

The data structures are used by 
- asari, tackable and scalable tool for LC-MS metabolomics processing
- mass2chem, utilities of chemical calculations, including annoTree
- Json's Metabolite Services

Develoeprs and data analysts are encouraged to write own classes to extend metDataModel.
